            2. extend() 
method adds multiple elements from an iterable (e.g., list, tuple) to the end of a list while maintaining the order of elements. It modifies the original list and is useful for merging collections.


            3. insert()

            5. pop() Method
The pop() method removes and returns an element at a specified index in a list while shifting subsequent elements left. If no index is given, it removes and returns the last element. It modifies the original list and raises an IndexError if the list is empty.


            6. clear() Method
The clear() method removes all elements from a list while keeping the list itself intact. It modifies the original list and results in an empty list.
