            1. get() Method
The get() method returns the value for the specified key if it exists in the dictionary. If the key is not found, it returns None or a user-defined default value. It does not raise an error like direct key access does.


            2. keys() Method
The keys() method returns a dynamic view of all the keys in the dictionary. The view updates automatically if the dictionary changes.


            3. values() Method
The values() method returns a view of all the values in the dictionary. Like keys(), it reflects any changes made to the dictionary.


            4. items() Method
The items() method returns a view object containing the dictionaryâ€™s key-value pairs as tuples. It is commonly used in loops to access both keys and values.


            5. update() Method
The update() method modifies the dictionary by adding key-value pairs from another dictionary or from keyword arguments. Existing keys will be updated, and new ones will be added.
